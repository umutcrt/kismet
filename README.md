*Are you ready for a brand new experience?


Once you find the hidden number, you will want to find it again and again every time.

You need to use your intelligence skills to reveal the mysterious numbers.

You can use hints to find numbers and their correct places and you can do score challenge with your friends.

You may even need to brainstorm with your friends.

It will be a pleasure for you to play this game with very entertaining graphics.




*How to play the game is quite simple;

You have to guess by entering 4 numbers each time.

Yellow and green colored clues will appear on each guess.

The yellow number that appears; It shows the number of correct numbers that are in the wrong places but exist in the number you are trying to find.

The green number is; It shows the number of correct numbers in the correct places and in the number you are trying to find.

You will have a total of 7 guesses.

Focus on the mysterious number and reveal the hidden number by developing new strategies.



*For example; Let our mystery number be "0812".
Suppose you also made a guess with the number "8672".
In this case; yellow:1 and green:1 hints will appear.
Because there are two numbers in our prediction, "8" and "2".
Since the number "2" is used in the correct place, 1 point in green appears, and 1 point in yellow appears because the number "8" is used in the wrong place.
Using these clues we need to reveal the hidden number in 7 tries.

Good luck.
