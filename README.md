## _Welcome to the Kismet app._

The aim of this game; find the 5-digit number randomly generated by the app!
The digits of the five-digit number produced by the application are different from each other.
When you confirm your guess by pressing the "OK" button, 1 point appears on the green arm for each number you use in the correct place. If you find a number in a different digit, 1 point appears on the yellow arm.

You are expected to reach the correct result in nine attempts.
For each consecutive win, your scoreboard will increase by 1 point.

If you press the skip button without finding the correct result, your scoreboard will be reset.
You can delete the prediction entries that you do not approve by pressing the Clear button.
You can confirm your guess by pressing the "OK" button.

I am sharing some screenshots with you.

I just started learning programming. I realize that my code is not clean. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
